# Code of Conduct

Contributors to this project are not a "community" and anybody who expects to
find "community" in an open source project will be better served elsewhere.
Absolutely everybody is welcome and encouraged to participate regardless of
personal or political identification or affiliation on the condition that they
not bring any personal or political issues to the project.

If you have a very intelligent explanation for why your personal or political
issue belongs in the open source project, then you are not welcome to contribute
to the project.
